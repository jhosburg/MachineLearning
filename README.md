# Machine Learning Project for CompE-596 SDSU

Our project will focus on predicting if someone has lung cancer or not using machine learning. The specific algorithms we are using are Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. 

The dataset we are using comes from:
```
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer/data
```

We are using Python for our project. Install python from:
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

## To run the program
1. First install pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn through the terminal. How to install them using pip is shown below:
```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
```
2. Next, run either lr.py or svm.py in the terminal. How to run them is shown below:
```
python lr.py
python scm.py
```
