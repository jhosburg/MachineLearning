# Machine Learning Project for CompE-596 SDSU

Our project will try to predict which side will win a round in a game of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive(CSGO). CSGO is a tactical first-person shooter(FPS) where terrorists(T) attempt to plant a bomb and counter-terrorists(CT) attempt to stop them. Each team of Ts and CTs have 5 players and battle it out until the first to win 16 rounds. Each round must be won by one of the two teams. Our project will utilize machine learning specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict round outcomes.

The dataset we are using comes from:
```

```

We are using Python for our project. Install python from:
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

## To run the program
1. First install pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn through the terminal. How to install them using pip is shown below:
```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
```
2. Next, Install the Jupyter Notebook extension for VSCode or have some software to view Jupyter Notebook

3. View the Jupyter Notebook file named:
```
CSGOWinner.ipynb
```
